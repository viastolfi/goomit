Here is a summarized version of the information:

**Summary**: Goomit is an auto-commit message generator that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate commit messages based on `git diff` results. It's currently a work in progress, but has potential.

**Key Features**:
* Uses LLMs to generate commit messages
* Integrates with `git diff`
* Supports multiple models via the `-m` argument

**Tech Stack**: Golang (v1.21+), Ollama (for model downloading)

This summary should provide a good context for generating commit message prompts using an LLMP.
